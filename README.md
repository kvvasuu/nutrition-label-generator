## General info

Welcome to Nutrition Label Generator, your go-to app for creating standard nutrition labels in just a few clicks. 
Simply input your nutritional values, and our app will generate a nutrition label for your products.

The application is divided into two sections. One of them is a form in which we provide values, and the other is a real-time generater label.
The label has values by default for demonstration purposes. When you enter a value in the form, it changes.

Below the label there is a button with which we can print the label - a system window pops up. This option is not supported on touch devices.


The application has been deployed on Netlify - [https://nutri-label.netlify.app/](https://nutri-label.netlify.app/)
